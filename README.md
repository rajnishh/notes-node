# Notes-Node
This is a example project for learning Command Line Input using Yargs library

This is basically a demonstration project for Notes in Node.js which meant to be explore Yargs library. I also used lodash library in this project.

descriptions of libraries:

YARGS
Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.

Yargs gives you:

commands and (grouped) options (like module run -n --force),
a dynamically generated help menu based on your arguments,
bash-completion shortcuts for commands and options,
and much more.
With these features, and many more, yargs allows you to focus on building your program without worrying about your args.

LODASH

Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
Manipulating & testing values
Creating composite functions
